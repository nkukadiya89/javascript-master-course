//  In low level Languages when creating an object ,
// we need to allocate memory to it and when we are
//  done using it we need to Deallocate it.

//  In JS we dont have the similar concept couse it has automatic Garbage collecctor
// The job of the Garbage collector is tp find the variables or constants that are no longer in use
// and then deallocate the memory that was allocated to them

// we do not have any control over the garbage collector
