//Objects in Js are quite like objects in real life
//They have properties & things they can do(methods)

let names = ['savan', 'bhuva', 'ok!'];
// names have methods like....
console.log(`
${names.length}
${names.sort()}
${window.innerWidth}
`)

//null is not an object as it has no methods

var name1 = 'mario'; //is not an object but it can behave like an object
console.log(name1.length);

var name2 = new String('halo');
console.log(name2);
